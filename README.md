**Learning Journey: Building TODO List App with Android APIs**

In a productive session of around 3 hours, I engaged in the development of a TODO List App, leveraging Android APIs, SharedPreferences, and user interface design considerations.

**Task 0 - Self-Exploration (1hr):**

Delving into the Week 5 "Content Slides" about Mobile UX, I identified three crucial criteria from Android design guidelines. Prioritizing user navigation, visual hierarchy, and consistent feedback as crucial elements, these choices aim to enhance user experience by ensuring seamless interactions and clear communication.

**Task 1 - UI Construction and Boilerplate Code (40 mins):**

The TODO List App's initial setup involved creating a project with an Empty Activity in Android Studio. With a ConstraintLayout for the MainActivity, I implemented a ListView, explored ArrayAdapter usage, and crafted a custom row layout using item.xml. Integrating an action bar for adding items and setting up an additional activity for item addition provided a glimpse into Android UI development.

**Task 2 - SharedPreferences and Data Handling (40 mins):**

Implementing SharedPreferences for data persistence between activities, especially for saving and retrieving TODO items, added a layer of complexity. Leveraging onStart and onStop methods to refresh the data source and handle item removal via item click events demonstrated a practical use of SharedPreferences for data management.

**Task 3 - Icon Customization (30 mins):**

Customizing icons for a more personalized TODO List App involved creating and integrating image assets for the action bar and launcher icons. This step enhanced the visual appeal and branding of the application.

**Task 4 - Self-Reflection (30 mins):**

Reflecting on the learning experience, the integration of SharedPreferences for persistent data management emerged as a valuable lesson. The ease of UI construction and understanding Android API interactions stood out positively. An evaluation of the overall experience, both in terms of challenges and achievements, highlighted the importance of iterative development and testing.

In conclusion, this exercise solidified my understanding of Android app development, emphasizing the significance of thoughtful UI design and efficient data handling. The Gibbs' model of self-reflection provided a structured approach to analyze, learn, and plan for future improvements. The action plan includes further exploration of advanced Android features and a focus on optimizing code for scalability.
